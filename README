These are my solutions to the Project Euler problems, found at http://projecteuler.net.

From the site:
"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems."

If you are actively trying to solve the problems on Project Euler, then these files may contain SPOILERS which will ruin the fun for yourself.

As of May 31/2011, I have solved 136 problems, and am ranked #47 in Canada (username RPKay).
