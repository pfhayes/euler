# Find the number of ways to arrange 2^5 binary digits
# in a circle such that every 5-bit number is contained
# as a substring in the cycle

# Observe that 00000 must be in the string. Then, it must be that
# 1000001 is in the string. We also must have 0111110 somewhere
# in the string as well, and there are only 2^18 bits left to set,
# which is a fairly reasonable number.
